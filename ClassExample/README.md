# ClassExample 

Illustrates the class (object) implementation in Objective-C. For each object e.g a ViewController, APIClient etc the convention is to create two separate files, a header file and an implementation file. The header file illustrates the template for methods, initializers. The implementation file defines the body for the methods, initializers.
